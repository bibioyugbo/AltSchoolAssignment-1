        <h3>MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h3>
        <p>My name is Obehioye Chrsitine Oyugbo. I am 23 years old and a fun fact about me is I love to play Chess. It is my favourite hobby. </p>
        <p>I am a gemini and my birthday is on the 22nd of May.</p>
        <p>My favourite food is amala and ewedu--It is my feel good food.</p>
        <p>I completed my secondary education at Loyola Jesuit College in Abuja, where I spent six years benefiting from a Jesuit education.</p>
        <p>Loyola shaped my future a lot and made me always remember to go for the magis in all that I do. I made sure to show forth the light.</p>
        <p>I continued my education at Afe Babalola university in Ado-Ekiti State where I graduated with a 1st class degree in Computer Science and was awarded the best graduating student.</p>
        <p>I love to learn new things and of course, make new friends. My friends have been a major pillar in my life.</p>
        <p>I have 3 siblings; 2 sisters and a brother.  I'm also the second born.</p>
        <p>I have been wearing glasses for about 15 years now, each pair weakens my eyesight unfortunately.</p>
        <p>I work a 9-5 but I hope one day I can pursue my long life dream of beecoming a musician. </p>
        <p>I love spontaneity and so I take the opportnity to try new things <i>all</i> the time.</p>
        <p>I love beauty and beauty products. So trying out new things like hair, lip glosses, powders is one of my favourite things to do.</p>
        <p>I also love to cook and have been doing it for many years. My family loves it when I do and mixing the flavors and spices is extremely fun for me. </p>

        <h3>WHY I JOINED ALT SCHOOL</h3>
            <p>Computer Science has always been interesting to me and I would like to think that's why I excelled in it in the university.</p>
            <p>I joined the Alt School Engineering program because I wanted to have access to one of the best tech schools in Africa, that will break down concepts in a way that is palatable to even newbies. </p>
            <p>I wanted a much broader knowledge scope than just frontend development and believe Alt School will make me into the full sttack develope I aspire to be.</p>
            <p>Kiki Mordi was grateful enough to provide a scholarship for women interested in tech. This made the program a lot more affordable and accessible to me. </p>
